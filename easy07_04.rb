# Swap Case
# Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string in which every uppercase letter is replaced by its lowercase version, and every lowercase letter by its uppercase version. All other characters should be unchanged.

# You may not use String#swapcase; write your own version of this method.

# Example:

# Copy Code
# swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
# swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'

def swapcase(string)
  string.chars.map do |character|
    character == character.downcase ? character.upcase : character.downcase
  end.join
end

p swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
p swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'
