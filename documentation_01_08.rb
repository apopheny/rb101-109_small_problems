# Included Modules

# For this exercise, start by using version 2.3.0 of the Ruby Array Documentation. If you use a more recent version of the documentation, you won't get the full benefit of this exercise. You don't have to install Ruby 2.3.0 - you can use any more recent version to test the code.

# Use irb to run the following code:

a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min(2)

# Find the documentation for the #min method and change the above code to print the two smallest values in the Array.
