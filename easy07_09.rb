# Multiply All Pairs

# Write a method that takes two Array arguments in which each Array contains a list of numbers, and returns a new Array that contains the product of every pair of numbers that can be formed between the elements of the two Arrays. The results should be sorted by increasing value.

# You may assume that neither argument is an empty Array.

# Examples:

# multiply_all_pairs([2, 4], [4, 3, 1, 2]) == [2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 12, 16]


def multiply_all_pairs(arr1, arr2)
  result = []
  arr1.map do |int1|
    arr2.map do |int2|
    int1 * int2
    end
  end.flatten.sort
end

p multiply_all_pairs([2, 4], [4, 3, 1, 2]) == [2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 12, 16]
