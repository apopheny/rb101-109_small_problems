# What Century is That?

# Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

# New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise the 20th century.

# Examples:

# century(2000) == '20th'
# century(2001) == '21st'
# century(1965) == '20th'
# century(256) == '3rd'
# century(5) == '1st'
# century(10103) == '102nd'
# century(1052) == '11th'
# century(1127) == '12th'
# century(11201) == '113th'
